                    <p>
                      The formulator in our program formulates rations on an ‘as is’ basis according to the National Research Council’s (NRC) standards
                      for all the animal species in our list. These are the animals daily requirements for the various stages
                      of growth and/or physiological phase of production and are used as typical recommendations for all
                      our categories. However, you can override any of these values if you wish to use other specifications.
